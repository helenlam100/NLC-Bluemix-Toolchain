### Why, When, and How
###### “The service enables developers without a background in machine learning or statistical algorithms to create natural language interfaces for their applications. The service interprets the intent behind text and returns a corresponding classification with associated confidence levels. The return value can then be used to trigger a corresponding action, such as redirecting the request or answering a question.

### Intended Use
##### The Natural Language Classifier is tuned and tailored to short text (1000 characters or less) and can be trained to function in any domain or application.
*	Tackle common questions from your users that are typically handled by a live agent.
*	Classify SMS texts as personal, work, or promotional
*	Classify tweets into a set of classes, such as events, news, or opinions.
*	Based on the response from the service, an application can control the outcome to the user. For example, you can start another application, respond with an answer, begin a dialog, or any number of other possible outcomes.

### Your input
*	Text to a pre-trained model

##### “The Natural Language Classifier is designed to be trained easily for your use case and data. The service is "well-read" in the content of Wikipedia. That background knowledge means that it can return classes for texts that it has not seen in training.”

### Popular uses
##### “One use of the service is to take some of the load off your support staff. Answer your customer's questions quickly and accurately. Take predictive actions, such as routing a user's question to the correct person in real time.”

Here are some other examples of how you might apply the Natural Language Classifier:
*	Twitter, SMS, and other text messages
*	Classify tweets into a set of classes, such as events, news, or opinions.
*	Analyze text messages into categories, such as Personal, Work, or Promotions.
*	Sentiment analysis
*	Analyze text from social media or other sources and identify whether it relates positively or negatively to an offering or service.
